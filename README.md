# stockpred
Its a simple stock prediction algorithm which tells wether the stock will rise or fall at the end of the month. You must install alpha-vantage package for python and replace your API key. I have built this on python version '3.7'. Place all of the files in the working directory. 

This is my first project please feel free to comment down on changes I need to consider in the future.
